# Pizza Jam
<!--- games -->
*2019*

In March 2019 a friend and I took part in [Pizza Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pizzajam2019), a 48-hour game jam. This was a busy 48 hours - especially as I had no experience with [Unity](https://unity.com/) or modern game development in general!

We made [The Weight of One's Crimes](https://helixxrain.itch.io/the-weight-of-my-crimes), a story-driven horror game. Overall, we came 26th out of 54, a firm mid-ground!
