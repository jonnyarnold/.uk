# ChronoCommit

*2014*

ChronoCommit uses GitHub users' location data and commit history to answer an interesting question: when do countries commit the most?

We took a week's worth of commits from the [GitHub Archive](http://githubarchive.org/) and found out where they came from and when they were done. Countries are coloured based on how many commits were done, relative to the country's maximum commits per hour.

This visualisation was created as part of the [Third Annual GitHub Data Challenge](https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge). I worked in a team of 4 over the course of a weekend to see what we could achieve with very little time.

You can view the visualisation [here](http://asgardenterprises.github.io/ChronoCommit/). All the code is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AsgardEnterprises/ChronoCommit).
