# Mysteries of the Neutrinos
<!--- physics -->
*2009-2010*

Neutrinos were subatomic particles first theorised in 1929 to solve issues with the Standard Model of particle physics. Around 50 trillion neutrinos pass through your body every second - however, due to their neutral charge and infrequent weak interactions with matter little is definitely known about them even today.

So what are the mysteries surrounding the neutrinos, and what possible explanations do we have for their curious behaviour? As part of my Physics course at Durham University I was asked to present a poster and presentation about what we *don't* know about neutrinos and the theories that attempt to explain them.
