# What's Your Manifesto?
<!--- culture,productivity -->

What do you stand for? When choosing between two good but opposed things, which do you choose and why?

These questions can be answered by a manifesto. I don't mean a political manifesto, which tends to promise you lots of good things and doesn't explain its concessions. I'm thinking about something more like the [Agile Manifesto](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/): it's short, decisive and tangible. I think the Agile Manifesto could be improved by explaining *why* they choose one thing over another, but it's still an insiprational example of making a statement. It's been pretty popular since its release!

I think manifestos are extremely useful at guiding people within a group. Furthermore, I feel the creation of a manifesto allows a group to resolve and discuss differences in opinion, leading to constructive resolutions.

## The Ingredients

What makes a manifesto good? I look for the following things:

- **Explicitly show trade-offs.** The format *"We favour X over Y"* gives you nowhere to hide.
- **When discussing trade-offs, both the one chosen and the one not chosen are positive.** For example, *"We favour happiness over sadness"* is a non-statement - everyone does. *"We favour employees' happiness over our customers'"* is much more of a statement.
- **Explain.** Stating something without giving a reason is difficult to critique in the future.

## An Example

When I was working at Reevoo I worked as part of a team to improve the software engineering department I was working in. We named the team The Meta Guild, and as part of our work we put together the following manifesto for the team:

> ### The Meta Guild Manifesto
> 
> The Meta Guild aims to make working in software better by changing the way we do things.
> 
> We favour:
> 
> *About improving how we work:*
> 
> **Long-term benefits eventually** over short-term benefits now.
> 
> We believe long-term benefits provide greater rewards and a more sustainable business model when compared to short-term benefits. Thereâ€™s more of the company in the long-term future than the short-term!
> 
> **Small** over large.
> 
> We believe small changes are easier to implement, more likely to succeed and easier to retract than large-scale changes.
> 
> **Process-less** over process-heavy.
> 
> We believe processes are usually unnecessary with the right people and are not fun to follow.
> 
> *About the work we do:*
> 
> **Exploration** over time-boxing.
> 
> We believe curiosity should be followed up, at the expense of an uncertain end.
> 
> **Experimenting and adapting** over planning and executing.
> 
> We believe experimentation copes with change better than planning, and that change is inevitable.
> 
> **Constantly challenging ideas** over committing to decisions.
> 
> We believe ideas should be subject to criticism to ensure they are good, both now and in the future.
> 
> *About people:*
> 
> **Autonomy and personal responsibility** over instruction and team responsibility.
> 
> We believe an autonomous, responsible workforce produces work they are proud of and are better at knowing how to organise themselves than management.
> 
> **Personal value** over organisational value.
> 
> We believe work that people personally benefit from will be of a higher quality than work that benefits the organisation as a whole.
> 
> **Individuals** over interchangeable people.
> 
> We believe nurturing people with diverse specialisms is more important for morale and breadth of ideas than conformity is for ease of organisation.
> 
> **Intrinsic motivation** over extrinsic motivation.
> 
> We believe people are better motivated by their own goals than rewards provided by others.
