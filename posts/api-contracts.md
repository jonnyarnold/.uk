As web developers, we traditionally have a client-side application that talks to a server-side application via HTTP requests. But how can we make sure that the latest changes to the server won't cause issues with the client, and vice versa? 

In this talk, I present a few ways that we've used TypeScript to address this problem at Trussle - as well as one way that we haven't tried, but could be the future...

*This talk was performed at the [London TypeScript](https://www.meetup.com/London-Typescript-Meetup/) March 2019 meet-up.
